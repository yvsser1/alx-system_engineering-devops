# Postmortem: The "Memory Leak Mayhem" Incident

---

### Issue Summary

**Duration:** The Great CRM Slowdown of 2021 lasted from 3:45 PM to 5:10 PM (UTC-5) on August 12, 2021.  
**Impact:** 60% of our users were caught in a virtual traffic jam, stuck in endless loading screens, timeouts, and sudden disconnections. It felt like our CRM tool had been hit by a digital molasses tsunami.  
**Root Cause:** A rogue memory leak was hoarding all the RAM like a dragon with gold, causing the CRM’s server to hit the snooze button—repeatedly.

### Timeline

*“Just a little slowness,” they said. “It’ll be fine,” they said.*  

- **3:45 PM** - Monitoring alerts screamed like a toddler who dropped their ice cream—CRM response times shot through the roof.
- **3:50 PM** - Tech support notices the flood of user complaints. It was like Black Friday at a Walmart, but with digital carts stuck in the checkout line.
- **4:00 PM** - We assumed the database was to blame (Spoiler: it wasn’t), so we poked around looking for slow queries or locks.
- **4:20 PM** - Database was clean. We turned our suspicious gaze to the network, expecting to find a tangled mess of packet loss. Nope, it wasn’t that either.
- **4:35 PM** - Called in the network team. They didn’t find anything suspicious, except for the fact that the CRM was still a hot mess.
- **4:50 PM** - Escalated to the dev team. *Cue heroic music.*
- **5:00 PM** - Devs discovered the memory leak, where our server was having a buffet of RAM. All-you-can-eat, apparently.
- **5:05 PM** - Rebooted the server to clear the RAM-hoarding gremlin. Temporary fix, but we could breathe again.
- **5:10 PM** - Applied the permanent fix. Everything back to normal. Crisis averted.

### Root Cause and Resolution

**The Villain:** A crafty memory leak within the CRM’s back-end server. It was sneakily hoarding memory like a squirrel before winter, eventually choking the server into a digital coma. The cause? Improper handling of data structures that kept on growing, kind of like that “just one more episode” habit.

**The Heroic Fix:**  
Step 1: Restarted the server to kick the gremlin out of its RAM nest.  
Step 2: Devs swooped in to patch up the faulty code, plugging the memory leak for good. No more hogging all the memory for itself.

*Here’s how we fixed it: (1) Identify leak, (2) Kick it out, (3) Patch it up.*

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**What We Learned:**  
- **Monitoring:** We need better alerts to catch memory hogs before they start throwing parties.
- **Logging:** Let’s get more detailed logs, so next time we can pinpoint the exact second things go haywire.
- **Code Review:** Memory leaks are sneaky. We’ll be hunting for these in our next code review.

**TODO List:**
1. Patch the CRM tool to make sure it doesn’t gobble up memory like it’s Thanksgiving.
2. Set up monitoring alerts for RAM usage—if it goes overboard, we’ll know before the server passes out.
3. Write scripts to auto-restart servers if they start acting greedy with memory.
4. Review our codebase to squash any other potential leaks.
5. Train the team on recognizing the signs of a memory leak before it turns into an outage.

In summary, the "Memory Leak Mayhem" was a lesson learned, and now we’ve fortified our defenses. Plus, we got some pretty solid memes out of it. Next time, we’ll catch that gremlin before it even gets close to our servers!
